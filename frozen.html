                <p>As Pixar becomes more imaginative, Disney's animation has grown mundane and unambitious. Despite advanced visuals, the essence and plot have regressed, prioritizing form over content. The sequel loses the original's celebration of female empowerment, turning instead to an environmental theme with a clichéd resolution. It ends with a predictable peace between kingdoms, a trope recently reused by Disney. While likely to succeed at the box office for its polish, this formulaic approach feels overdone, missing the diversity of past films.</p>

                <p>The sequel exudes a lukewarm vibe typical of follow-ups, feeling like a grand music video with awkward singing moments, with Kristoff clinching the award for most awkward singer (a grown man, out of place with his ballads!). Anna's awakening from darkness may rival "Let It Go" as a classic moment. Elsa, like a fairy in a wedding gown against dreamy backdrops, makes you wish you could pause and savor every frame for minutes on end!</p>
